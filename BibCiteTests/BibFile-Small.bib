annote = {- patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 and normal subjects with trans- cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the medial cer- ebellum were specifically impaired on absolute timing tasks such as comparing the absolute duration of single intervals and not on relative timing tasks based on rhythmic sequences with a regular beat (Grube et al., 2010a,b)

Methods:
- Although it is sometimes possible to perceive a beat even in jittered sequences, the above stimulus parameters were carefully tested in pilot experiments to eliminate any beat-based percept in the irregular sequences.
- block of irregular first, then block of regular},
